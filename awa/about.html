                <!--About Arctic World Archive-->
                <p>
                    When the Arctic World Archive was inaugurated in March 2017 it was the result of a unique collaboration between Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani (SNSK), a more than 100-year-old mining company located at Svalbard, and Piql, an innovative technology company located on mainland Norway.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The ambition for the Arctic World Archive is to be a secure world archive to help preserve the world's digital memory and ensure that the world's most irreplaceable digital memories of art, culture and literature are secured and made available to future generations.
                    <br/><br/>

                    <blockquote>
                    <p>It is an amazing feeling to know that
                    my own nation’s memory will be
                    kept safe for future generations to
                    see on this arctic island.

                    A large number of factors related to technology and societal change, wars and potential natural disasters make it extremely demanding to preserve digital memories for centuries and the Arctic World Archive has the ambition of being one of the most important global initiatives to achieve just this. that the information is passed on to future generations so that those with knowledge of their past can have a meaningful present and future.

                <h2>SNSK</h2>
                <p>
                    SNSK is headquartered in Longyearbyen. The company was founded in November 1916 and took over coal mining in Longyearbyen after the American company Arctic Coal Company. Since then, Store Norske has been operating coal mines in Svalbard continuously, with the exception of a period during World War II. SNSK has solid experience with industrial operations under extreme, arctic conditions.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The company is 100 percent owned by the Norwegian state and the authorities have always considered SNSK's business in a broader perspective than the purely corporate economy. The company is an important player in maintaining a stable, Norwegian family community in Svalbard.
