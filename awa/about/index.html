        <!--About Arctic World Archive-->
        <p>
            The Arctic World Archive (AWA) was inaugurated in March 2017 as a unique collaboration between Store Norske
            Spitsbergen Kulkompani (<a href="https://www.snsk.no/" target="_blank">SNSK</a>), a more than 100-year-old
            mining company located at Svalbard, and Piql AS, an innovative technology company located on mainland
            Norway.
            <br /><br />
            The first deposits were made by the National Archives of Mexico and Brazil, followed by a growing number of
            organisations from over 15 countries, including the Vatican Library, the National Museum of Norway, the
            European Space Agency, the Museum of the Person, Alinari and major global corporations.
            <br /><br />
            Our ambition is to be a secure world archive to help preserve the world's digital memory and ensure that the
            world's most irreplaceable digital memories of art, culture and literature are secured and made available to
            future generations.

                <p class="uk-margin-small-bottom">It is an amazing feeling to know that my own nation’s memory will be
                    kept safe for future generations to see on this arctic island.

                A large number of factors related to technology and societal change, wars and potential natural
                disasters make it extremely demanding to preserve digital memories for centuries and AWA has the
                ambition of being one of the most important global initiatives to achieve just this. that the
                information is passed on to future generations so that those with knowledge of their past can have a
                meaningful present and future.

            <h2 style="font-size:50px;">The Technology</h2>

            <p>
                The technology used to store the data is as important as the Archive itself. Most digital storage
                mediums have a limited lifetime, and hardware, software and file formats become obsolete as technology
                evolves
                <br><br>
                The purpose-built digital medium can last for over 1000 years in the archive with guaranteed future
                accessibility. The storage medium, piqlFilm, is futureproof and technology independent, so no matter how
                much time has passed and how technology has evolved, the data will still be accessible.
                <br><br>
                The technology can withstand extreme electromagnetic exposure and has undergone extensive longevity and
                accessibility testing.

            <!--About SNSK-->
            <a href="https://www.snsk.no/" target="_blank">
                <h2 style="font-size:50px;" class="uk-margin-medium-top">SNSK</h2>
            </a>
            <p>
                SNSK is headquartered in Longyearbyen. The company was founded in November 1916 and took over coal
                mining in Longyearbyen after the American company Arctic Coal Company. Since then, Store Norske has been
                operating coal mines in Svalbard continuously, with the exception of a period during World War II. SNSK
                has solid experience with industrial operations under extreme, arctic conditions.
                <br /><br />
                The company is 100 percent owned by the Norwegian state and the authorities have always considered
                SNSK's business in a broader perspective than the purely corporate economy. The company is an important
                player in maintaining a stable, Norwegian family community in Svalbard.

                new and better solutions. One of these solutions is a migration-free and self-contained storage medium
                with unique long-term properties.
                <br /><br />
