            <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight: lighter;">
                Some plants begin life as a seed, a seed
                that can easily be preserved, in e.g.
                Svalbard Global Seed Vault, and planted
                when we need it in the future. Other crops
                are dependent on preservation of the
                living plant itself to be able to guarantee its
                existence in the future. With the latter, the
                cryopreservation-method, in which a piece
                of the biological material is frozen, can be
                the solution.

                <br><br>

                To be able to utilize the biological material in the future,
                it is also necessary to have access to the information related
                to the plant. Information that describes the seeds, how they are grown,
                the health status of the plant, how to utilise the crops, photos etc

                <br><br>
                Thus far, the information and the plant
                material have been stored in different locations. The data could be stored on paper, hard drives, CD’s
                or similar, where
                there is no direct connection with the biological material. If the data is digital,
                it has to be transferred from one digital
                storage medium to the next due to short
                lifespan of hardware, in order to survive with
                the plant.

                <br><br>

                GeneEver combines unique biotechnology
                with unique data storage technology and
                offers long term co-preservation of seeds
                and living plant material combined with its
                associated data and information.

                <br><br>

                This is a new, comprehensive solution that
                guarantees access to fresh and healthy
                food coupled with the information on how
                it can be cultivated in the future.

            <h2 class="uk-margin-medium-top" style="color:#ed7d31; font-weight: bold;">The Cryo method</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight: lighter;">
                The cryo method has become an increasingly
                used and recognised tool to keep living plant
                material alive all across the world. The
                method consists of placing small shot
                tips from the living plant in liquid nitrogen
                (N2 -196°Celsius), a solid method that safeguards all the genetic information.
            </p>


            <h2 class="uk-margin-medium-top" style="color:#ed7d31; font-weight: bold;">The related information is just
                as important!</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight: lighter;">
                Piql has developed a new storage
                technology that can secure access to the
                information concerning the biological material in the future. Piql solves the challenges
                related to developments in technology
                with a unique, migration free and “selfcontained” storage solution for digital and
                visual (i.e. human readable) information.
                The storage medium has unique long-term
                attributes that become even better when
                the storage medium is stored in a cold and
                dry climate (e.g. at Svalbard).

                <br><br>
                Migration free implies that the data does
                not have to be transferred from one storage
                medium to another due to obsolescence
                of the storage medium itself or related
                hardware or software. With Piql’s solution
                the data is written to Piql’s storage medium once – and it will stay there, until someone needs to read
                it back, e.g. when other
                storage systems are no longer accessible or
                fail. Today’s storage technology has a lifespan of typically 5 years. Who has a computer older than 5
                years?

                <br><br>

                “Self-contained” implies that all the information needed to retrieve the data in the
                future is contained on the storage medium
                in clear text, making it possible to read and
                GeneEver
                understand how to use future “off-the-shelf”
                technology to read back the data. On conventional storage technology (e.g. hard
                disk, CD or magnetic tape), there is no such
                clear text information available, and you
                would need specific technology to read the
                data back.

                <br><br>

                Reading back data from Piql’s technology
                in the future can be done independently
                of specific vendors. One would only need a
                light source, a digital camera and a computer of some sort. If these three things exist in the future,
                the data will always be
                retrievable.

                <br><br>

                Piql’s storage technology is by far the most
                sustainable storage technology on the market. It requires minimal or zero energy (when
                e.g. data is stored at Svalbard) to keep the
                data alive for future generations.

            <h2 class="uk-margin-medium-top" style="color:#ed7d31; font-weight: bold;">Cryobox</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.5; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight: lighter;">
                We have, with support from Oslofjord
                Regional Research Fund, the Research
                Council of Norway, Innovation Norway
                in cooperation with Sagaplant, Norwegian
                Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO),
                Norner and EGGS Design developed the
                Cryobox.

                <br><br>

                The Cryobox is designed in a way which
                allows the biological material and the
                related information to be cryo preserved
                together. This way, one does not need
                to keep a separate archive to be able to
                access the information in the future.

                <br><br>

                Apart from Sagaplant in Norway, the Cryobox
                has been tested by Luke Natural Resources
                Institute in Finland and the Catholic University
                of Leuven in Belgium.
